SUBSTRATE STIFFNESS

- Young's modulus: the stiffness of the substrate in kPa
- Contant: substrate stiffness is uniform
- Heterogeneous: substrate stiffness is heterogeneous and the stiffness profile can be defined via the "Edit" button
- Gradient: substrate stiffness is defined based on piecewise gradients and the gradient profile can be defined via the "Edit" button
- Edit: edit the heterogeneous or gradient stiffness profiles
- Use imported substrate data: select to use the stiffness data from the imported simulation
