GEOMETRY ANALYSIS

- Area: show the area distribution in the time point selected in the "Plot" panel
- Perimeter: show the perimeter distribution in the time point selected in the "Plot" panel
- Neighbors: show the number of neighbors distribution in the time point selected in the "Plot" panel
- Area vs time: show the area distribution as a function of time during the simulation
- Perimeter vs time: show the perimeter distribution as a function of time during the simulation
