FORCE MAGNITUDE PLOTTING

- Force: select a force from the dropdown whose magnitude is to be shown for each cell vertex or substrate point. Only the force available in the imported results are shown.
- Marker size: define the size of the scatter point in the force magnitude plot. Selecting a suitable value can be done via trial-and-error
- Minimum magnitude: the lower limit for the force magnitude color range. Selecting a suitable value can be done via trial-and-error
- Maximum magnitude: the upper limit for the force magnitude color range. Selecting a suitable value can be done via trial-and-error
